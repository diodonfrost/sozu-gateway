# Feature support

What the controller does and does not do today (Phase 1 Ingress + TLS, Phase 2 Gateway
API, Phase 3 HTTPRoute filters). It distinguishes what Sōzu
**fundamentally cannot do** from what is simply **not wired up yet**, so a hard constraint is never
mistaken for a roadmap item.

## Notes

- **Regex paths (`ImplementationSpecific`).** Sōzu 2.x anchors regexes, so a pattern that matched a
  substring on another controller may need adjusting.
- **API-gateway filters.** Header edits, redirects (scheme + status) and URL rewrites (host +
  full path) are exposed through the IR and Gateway API HTTPRoute filters (Phase 3). Sōzu has no
  header *append*, so a Gateway `add` is applied as a set; redirect host/path/port targets and
  `URLRewrite.replacePrefixMatch` are not expressible yet and are reported rather than half-applied.
  Basic auth and per-IP rate limiting exist in Sōzu's data plane but have no core Gateway API
  filter, so they remain unwired.
- **Hard limits.** Matching on header values or query parameters, weighted traffic split across
  several Services, and request mirroring are not expressible in Sōzu today, so they are out of
  scope rather than merely deferred.

## Annotations

Cluster-level routing is tuned with annotations on the backing **Service** (a cluster is 1:1 with a
Service, so both an Ingress and a Gateway route to that Service share one configuration):

| Annotation | Values | Default | Effect |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| `sozu.io/load-balancing` | `round-robin`, `random`, `least-loaded`, `power-of-two` | `round-robin` | Sōzu load-balancing algorithm for the cluster. Unknown values fall back to the default. |
| `sozu.io/sticky-sessions` | `"true"` / `"false"` | `"false"` | Pin a client to one backend via a Sōzu sticky cookie. |
